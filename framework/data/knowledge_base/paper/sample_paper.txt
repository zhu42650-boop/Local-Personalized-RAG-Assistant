Title: Multi-Agent Coordination for Scientific Discovery

Abstract
We study multi-agent coordination in scientific discovery tasks. Our approach uses
a shared memory and explicit role assignment to improve hypothesis generation and
evidence aggregation. Experiments show gains on literature review and experiment
planning benchmarks.

Introduction
Multi-agent systems are increasingly used for complex scientific workflows. These
workflows require long-horizon planning, collaborative reasoning, and consistent
knowledge updates. We propose a coordination framework that decomposes tasks into
specialized roles and uses a shared memory to track hypotheses and citations.

Related Work
Prior work on agent collaboration focuses on tool use, debate, or voting. In
scientific contexts, these methods often suffer from fragmented memory and weak
evidence tracking.

Method
Our system defines three roles: Planner, Researcher, and Verifier. The Planner
decomposes goals into subtasks, the Researcher gathers evidence, and the Verifier
checks consistency and citation integrity. A shared memory store captures claims,
supporting evidence, and confidence scores. The system updates memory with a
conflict-resolution rule based on citation overlap and confidence.

Experiments
We evaluate on two datasets: a literature review task and an experiment design
task. Metrics include factual consistency, citation accuracy, and task completion
time. Our approach improves citation accuracy by 12% and reduces task time by 18%.

Discussion
The shared memory improves collaboration but can become a bottleneck with many
agents. We discuss sharding strategies and selective memory updates to address
scalability.

Conclusion
We present a coordination framework for multi-agent scientific discovery. The
approach improves citation accuracy and overall task performance.
